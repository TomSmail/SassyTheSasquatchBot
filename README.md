# SassyTheSasquatchBot
A discord bot of the fictional character sassy. The bot works by recording the number of messages each user sends and storing it. These are translated into points and can be used to send silly messages at other users in the server that the bot is in. The target user will not know who has @ them and sent the pre written message. The messages are a mixture of Australian slang and mild language! 


The commands are: 

/menu - displays the avaliable messages and their respecitve "costs"

/raid - allows the users to select where they want to send the message, who they want to send it to and which message they want to send

/check - checks the number of points the user has

There are also functions for what will happen if the user doesn't have enough points etc. 


This was just a bit of fun as I learnt how to write java, this is my first java project.
